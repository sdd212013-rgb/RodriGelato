  <p><i>Jellyfin Stremio Integration Plugin</i></p>
</div>

Bring the power of Stremio addons directly into Jellyfin. This plugin replaces Jellyfin’s default search with Stremio-powered results and can automatically import entire catalogs into your library through scheduled tasks, seamlessly injecting them into Jellyfin’s database so they behave like native items.

### Features
- **Unified Search** – Jellyfin search now pulls results from Stremio addons
- **Catalogs** – Import items from stremio catalogs into your library with scheduled tasks
- **Realtime Streaming** – Streams are resolved on demand and play instantly
- **Database Integration** – Stremio items appear like native Jellyfin items
- **Act as an proxy** - Streams are proxied through Jellyfin, so debrid sees everything as a single IP.
- **Per user settings** - Users can have their own manifest, perfect for age restricted accounts.
- **More Content, Less Hassle** – Expand Jellyfin with community-driven Stremio catalogs

## Usage

1. Setup an aiostreams manifest. You can selfhost or use an public instance, for example: [Elfhosted public instance](https://aiostreams.elfhosted.com/stremio/configure)
   
   If you are new to debrid and are signing up please use one of my <a href="https://github.com/lostb1t/Gelato?tab=readme-ov-file#support-me">referrals</a>.
   
   At minimum you need the **tmdb addon enabled** for search and one addon that provides streams (comet for example).
   Alternative you can import the [starter config](aiostreams-config.json). Remember to enable your debrid providers under services after importing the config.
   
   **p2p support currently in beta**

2. Make sure you are running Jellyfin 10.11 and add `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lostb1t/Gelato/refs/heads/gh-pages/repository.json` to your plugin repositories.

3. Install and configure the plugin.
   **Nota:** Ahora soporta **cualquier addon de Stremio** (Torrentio, Comet, MediaFusion, Orion, etc.).  
AIOStreams sigue siendo compatible si quieres un agregador.

4. Add the configured base paths to the Jellyfin library of your choice. After adding them, start a library scan.

4.5 For shows, enable the "Gelato missing season/episode fetcher" and put
it on too of the metadata downloaders.

5. Profit! Now search for your favorite movie and start streaming. Or run the catalog import task to populate your db.

### FAQ

- You need to restart the server after editing the manifest/config in aiostreams.
- You should have at least one search enabled catalog. I suggest the tmdb addon.
- if something borked or you want to start over, you can use the purge task under scheduled tasks.
- I suggest lowering the default timeout on your stremio addons in aiostreams (5 seconds for example)
- debridio tmdb and debridio tvdb are pronlematic. I suggest using the regular tmdb addon.
- Stream cache can be cleared by restarting the server
